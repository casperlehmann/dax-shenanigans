DAX is a proprietary query language for the MS Analysis Service/Power BI platform. There are things DAX is good at, but there are also many problems that it was never meant to solve. This repo is for documenting examples of the latter.

[Dynamic Algebra](dynamic-algebra/dynamic-algebra.md) is a seemingly easy problem that many new users ask for. I found a solution that made it possible. Take a look at the code to see why implementing it is a bad idea. Or take user NbdySpcl_00's word for it:
